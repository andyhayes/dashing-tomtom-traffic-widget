# dashing-tomtom-traffic-widget

[Dashing](http://dashing.io/) widget and job to display driving times of a route. Uses [TomTom](http://developer.tomtom.com/io-docs/) for free traffic information.


Based on original gist: https://gist.github.com/sighmin/5628306 and mildly re-styled and tweaked to show warnings (amber) and alerts (red) when there are delays. Also switches to show "Journey In" before 12pm and "Time Home" after.
